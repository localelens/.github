# LocaleLens

**Simple, developer-first translation management.**

LocaleLens is a lightweight localization platform built for modern web applications. It focuses on clarity, control, and developer experience — without enterprise bloat.

We're building tools that fit naturally into existing i18n workflows and scale from small projects to real production systems.

---

## Why LocaleLens?

Most localization tools are either:

- ❌ **Too simple** (JSON files + manual sync)
- ❌ **Too heavy** (enterprise-first, complex workflows)
- ❌ **Not built with developers in mind**

LocaleLens aims to sit in the middle:

- ✅ Works with existing i18n setups (e.g. i18next, react-i18next)
- ✅ Clear limits and transparent pricing
- ✅ API-first, predictable behavior
- ✅ AI suggestions as an assist, not a requirement
- ✅ Designed for teams, but friendly to solo devs

## Core Principles

### Developer experience first
Clear APIs, predictable behavior, no magic.

### Transparency over abstraction
You always know where translations live and how they're used.

### Progressive complexity
Start simple, scale only when you need to.

### AI as a tool, not a lock-in
Helpful suggestions, never mandatory.
